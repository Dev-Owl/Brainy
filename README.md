## whoisthere.py
Simple and dirty script to read connected devices from the webfrontend of my netgear router and prompt as JSON. Including IP,Name and MAC.
Requires the Python module https://github.com/requests/requests

*Please note: You might have to adjust the IP and hopefully the password in the GET request*
